# Computer Networks Experiments Repository

Welcome to my repository where I delve into the vast world of computer networks, starting from scratch. Here, you will find a collection of experiments, documentation, and projects dedicated to understanding and implementing various computer network protocols, architectures, and systems.

The journey of learning is structured into different topics, each with its dedicated space for in-depth exploration and hands-on experimentation.

## Topics Covered

### 1. DNS Server

The first topic we explore is the DNS (Domain Name System) Server. This fundamental backbone of the internet translates human-friendly domain names into machine-readable IP addresses, allowing us to browse the web with ease.

Stay tuned as this repository grows with more topics and experiments in the field of computer networks.
